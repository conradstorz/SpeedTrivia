"""SpeedTriva takes input from individual players via SMS using Twillio service.
Players can send their name by text and get back the names of their teammates.
Teams are "Randomly" assigned. 
This app tracks players from past events and strives to assign players together
that have not been at the same table before (like speed dating). 
Player can provide their personal name to the app and include a +1 (or +2 or more) 
to their name to reserve extra seats at their table.
FUNCTIONALITY:
    Incoming SMS;
        First ever incoming SMS becomes Control-Node.
            After that all new numbers are considered players.
                (Control is also player)
        Players can provide details like:
            Name, Team Size(are they alone or have brought partner(s)), 
            Whois (responds with names of other players assigned to table),
            Decline (Ask to be reassigned to different table),
            Team-Name (set it or ask for it), Name-suggestions (offer silly team name),
        Control can provide same as above, plus;
            Shuffle (re-shuffles players), Set-size (set the target size of each table),
            Table-list (returns list of all players and assignments),
            Send-Assignments (sends each player their tablename (e.g. epsilon, gamma, delta...)),

MINIMUM FUNCTIONALITY:
    Default table size equals 4.
    Incoming SMS is placed in the database and body of SMS is used as name and +n value.
        duplicate SMS phone numbers just updates the name and +n values.
    Control can Shuffle tables and send assignments to players.
    No stateful memory is needed between nights a this level.

CRAZY FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY:
    Player can provide the answer to the trivia question by SMS and SpeedTrivia will submit it 
    to the trivia host by filling in the jotform used for answers that night.

    Controller can provide actual answers for storage in the database and matching to the provided
    answers from the teams to keep score automatically within the app. (Alternately the player can
    tell SpeedTrivia when they get a question right so the score can be kept.)

# NOTE: On 4-8-2021 I decided to use PythonAnywhere.com to host this code. 
    It can be accessed at Conradical.pythonanywhere.com/sms
    Twilio.com sends incoming texts from the number (812)203-8235 to the address above.
    The resulting string generated by sms_reply() is then returned to the player.
    An empty string from sms_reply() returns nothing and generates no return text.
    At this time I do not use environment variables at PA.com
    I simply cut and paste the un-encrypted secrets into the code at PA.com
    That code doesn't get pushed to GIT ever so the secrets are fairly safe.

# NOTE: Reading the Twilio website I learned about ngrok.exe
    ngrok is available for all computer platforms and creates tunnels from localhost to the public internet.
    Using ngrok allows testing servers like flask running on localhost with internet resources like Twilio.
    During developement of a webapp like SpeedTriva ngrok allows me to point Twilio at my localhost for testing.
    Deployment to production can then point Twilio back to Conradical.pythonAnywhere.com
